    <description>Worldwide, 160,000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year and despite tremendous progress, cancer remains        the #1 disease killer of children in the U.S. and Canada. The St. Baldrick’s Foundation raises funds for childhood cancer research by hosting worldwide head-shaving events, where volunteers shave their heads in public to show solidarity with the children who typically lose their hair during treatments. These “shavees” receive pledges of financial support from their friends and family. In turn their generous donations help fund life-saving childhood cancer research</description>
